“The groan of stressed metal and the heavy thud of docking clamps jolt you from a fitful sleep.” 
“You're curled up between two large crates, the air thick with the smell of ozone, machine oil, and something faintly sweet, like spiced Piltovan pastries."
"Darkness presses in, broken only by thin slivers of bright, morning light filtering through cracks in the cargo hold's hull."
"Outside, the sounds are a rising cacophony: the whir of Hex-draulics, the rhythmic clank of boots on metal walkways, and the barked orders of a Piltovan crew boss." \"Secure the main ramp! Get those manifests ready for the Inspectors!"\
"A deeper, more authoritative voice cuts through the noise. \"Standard sweep. Check all compartments. We had a report of a stowaway on a vessel from the south last week. Can't be too careful."\
"You've arrived in Piltover, the City of Progress." 
"But you're in the belly of the beast, and it sounds like they're about to come looking for you." 
"The main cargo ramp is likely being lowered now, but it will be swarming with crew and those imposing Enforcers." 
"You need to find another way out, and fast. From your hiding spot, what do you do?"

"You press yourself deeper into the shadows, your eyes straining to adjust to the gloom." 
"The hold is a chaotic maze of crates of all shapes and sizes, some bearing the sigils of Piltovan merchant clans, others stamped with warnings about fragile contents."
"The air is stuffy and still, a stark contrast to the bustling activity you can hear just outside the hull. You need to get a better sense of your options before you make a move."

"Roll: Success or Fail"

"Your eyes, accustomed to the dim light, begin to pick out details in the cluttered space."
"The main source of light and noise is the massive cargo ramp, now fully lowered." 
"It opens onto a sun-drenched dock, and you can clearly see the silhouettes of at least two armored Enforcers standing guard, their long rifles held at a low ready." "Several crew members are already moving up the ramp, their boots clanging loudly as they begin hauling the first line of crates out of the hold." 
"They're sticking to the wide central aisle for now, but it's only a matter of time before they start spreading out."
"Your gaze sweeps away from the dangerous main exit, searching the periphery. High above a precarious stack of crates to your left, you spot it: a square maintenance hatch on the ceiling, its edges faintly outlined by dust. It looks like it leads up into the ship's superstructure."
"To your right, tucked away behind a large, tarp-covered machine, you see a small service panel on the wall, about chest-high. It's unmarked, but a faint draft seems to be coming from it, suggesting it leads somewhere. The crew is getting closer. What's your move?"
"You have three potential paths:"


    menu:
        "The Main Ramp: A direct but incredibly risky path, straight past the crew and the Enforcers."
            jump
        "The Ceiling Hatch: A vertical escape. It's high up and would require a climb, but it's far from the prying eyes on the dock."
            jump
        "The Service Panel: A hidden route. It's location is secure, but you have no idea what's on the other side, and it might be difficult to open."
            jump

    scene







You've made your choice. Ignoring the obvious trap of the main ramp and the unknown of the service panel, you set your sights on the ceiling hatch. It's the most difficult path, but also the one least likely to be watched.
The first challenge is the climb. The crates are stacked high and unevenly, forming a precarious staircase of wood and metal. You'll need to be strong and sure-footed to make it to the top without sending the whole pile crashing down and alerting the entire dock.
[SYSTEM] This will require a Strength (Athletics) check. As a former boxer, your strength is your asset, and your New Kid In Town ability gives you advantage. Please roll two d20s, add your Strength modifier (+2), your proficiency bonus (+2, as you are proficient and have expertise in Athletics), and tell me the highest total.


[SYSTEM] A total of 10 is not quite enough to navigate the unstable pile of cargo silently.
You take a deep breath and begin your ascent. You pull yourself up onto the first large crate, your muscles coiling with practiced ease. The second and third levels are just as easy. But as you reach for a handhold on a smaller, metal-bound box near the top, your foot slips on a patch of condensation.
The box wobbles precariously. For a heart-stopping moment, you manage to steady it, but your shift in weight causes a cascade effect. The metal box slides off its perch with a loud scrape, then tumbles down the side of the stack, striking a wooden crate with a sharp CRACK before landing on the metal deck with a deafening CLANG!
Silence descends upon the cargo hold, a heavy, sudden blanket that smothers the sounds from the dock. Every head snaps in your direction. A young crewman, his eyes wide, points a trembling finger at your exposed position near the top of the crates. "Hey! There's someone up there!"
The two Enforcers at the ramp immediately raise their rifles, the blue glow of their hex-crystal capacitors intensifying. "Hold it! Right there! Don't move!" one of them shouts, his voice amplified and metallic.
There's nowhere to run. Within moments, you are surrounded. The Enforcers handle you roughly, their armored grips like iron vices on your arms. They find your shiv and toss it aside with a clatter. After a quick, fruitless search for identification or coin, they drag you out of the airship and onto the pristine, sun-bleached docks of the Commerce District.
The lead Enforcer, a woman with a severe haircut and a jaw set like granite, looks you up and down with disdain. "No papers, no coin, no reason to be here. Another stray from the gutters." She jerks her head towards a long, imposing bridge that spans the chasm between the two cities. "Escort him to the North Bridge. Toss him over to Zaun where he belongs. And if we see your face in Piltover again without proper writ, you'll be seeing the inside of a cell."
The journey is short and humiliating. You're marched across the bridge, the gleaming spires of Piltover at your back. At the halfway point, the Enforcers shove you towards a set of stairs leading down into the chasm. "Go on, get," one of them spits. "Welcome to the Undercity."
You descend into a different world. The clean, orderly architecture of Piltover gives way to a chaotic jumble of rusted metal, stained brass, and grimy brick. The air grows thick, heavy with the smell of coal smoke, chemical runoff, and unwashed bodies. This is the Alcove District, the part of Zaun that huddles just across the river from its wealthy twin. While the buildings here are still above ground, they are rundown, leaning on each other for support. The sky is a crisscrossing web of pipes and makeshift walkways.
You are free, but you are stranded in a city that feels infinitely more dangerous than the one you just left. You can feel the eyes of the locals on you—some curious, some predatory. The freedom here is laced with menace. As the reality of your situation sinks in, the immediate need for shelter becomes your most pressing concern. The Zaunite night, you've heard, is not kind to the unprepared.

(I don't like all of the eyes on me, I try to slink into the shadows until I can get my bearings)

Your New Kid In Town ability gives you advantage on this roll. Roll two d20s, add your Dexterity modifier (+2) to the higher roll, and report the total.
You pull your collar up, trying to make yourself as small as possible. The street is a chaotic river of people, but their gazes feel sharp, lingering on you, the newcomer. Your best bet is a narrow, uninviting alleyway just ahead. It's choked with shadows and dripping pipes, a perfect place to disappear if you can make it there without drawing more attention. You take a breath and prepare to move.


[I roll a total of 7]
(I shake my head) *5 minutes in town and already... a scrap)* Well you see Scrim... I'm already lost, and stumbled into this alley, and suddenly this became my business. (I loosen up my shoulders a bit) You heard Zev, its his find. Why don't you just let him keep what his?
(I choose to launch an attack) [I roll 22 to hit]

[I roll a total of 14dmg]
Show thinking
The force of your blow is tremendous. It's not just a punch; it's a statement. The 14 points of damage slams through Scrim's defenses, his consciousness, and his entire sense of superiority. His eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses like a sack of bricks, hitting the grimy alley floor with a heavy, final thud. He is completely unconscious, a trickle of blood leaking from the corner of his mouth.
In the sudden, ringing silence, the only sound is the quiet whimpering of Zev, who is staring at you with a mixture of terror and awe. He looks from Scrim's motionless form back to you, his eyes wide.
The fight is over before it truly began. Scrim is defeated, lying insensate at your feet.
[SYSTEM] According to the rules of engagement, you have the opportunity to decide Scrim's fate. Do you wish to deliver a Lethal or Non-Lethal finishing blow? Your choice may have consequences.
I will update the combat tracker to reflect the outcome.
[Non-Lethal] Steady on Zev. (I rifle through Scrim's pockets and count his coin). You know a place I can crash for the night around here for... (I count Scrims cogs) 45 cogs?
Show thinking
You decide against any further violence. The man is beaten, and that's enough. You give Scrim's unconscious form a final, dismissive glance before turning your attention to his pockets. A quick search yields a small, worn leather pouch containing a handful of coins. You count out 45 copper cogs. It's not much, but it's more than you had.
Your words seem to break Zev out of his terrified trance. He flinches when you speak to him, but his eyes are wide with a dawning sense of hero-worship.
"S-steady," he stammers, nodding quickly. He watches you count the coins, his grip still tight on the cog-driver he protected. "A place to crash? For... for that?" He glances at the coins in your hand. "That'll get you a cot in a flophouse for a few hours, maybe. And you're likely to wake up with less than you went in with."
He looks from you to the unconscious bully on the ground, and a spark of courage seems to ignite in his chest.
"Listen," he says, his voice gaining a bit of confidence. "You... you saved me. Scrim would've taken this driver and probably broken a few of my fingers for fun. My hovel... it ain't much. It's just a corner in a boiler-room, really. But it's dry, and the door is reinforced. No one will bother you there."
He looks at the cog-driver in his hands, then back at you. "You can stay. No charge. You... you look like you can handle yourself. And down here, that's worth more than cogs. My name's Zev." He extends a greasy, but sincere, hand.
[SYSTEM] You have successfully completed the "Down Below" event. By accepting Zev's offer, you will gain your first base of operations and a potential new ally. I am updating your Player Information Sheet with your rewards from the fight and your new relationship status with Zev.
[I do an insight check on Zev]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] Of course. You take a moment to study Zev as he makes his earnest offer. To gauge his true intentions, please make a Wisdom (Insight) check. Your New Kid In Town ability grants you advantage on this roll. Roll two d20s, take the higher result, and subtract 1 (for your Wisdom modifier). Report the total.
You look past his outstretched, grimy hand and into his eyes. He's still trembling slightly, but his gaze is direct. You're trying to see if this is some kind of trap, if his offer of shelter is genuine or just a ploy to get you somewhere more secluded. In Zaun, an act of kindness can often be a mask for something far more sinister.
[I roll a 2 , bonus applied]
Show thinking
You peer into Zev's face, trying to find a flicker of deception in his wide, watery eyes. But your senses are overwhelmed. The smell of chem-fumes, the lingering adrenaline from the fight, the deep shadows of the alley—it all combines to cloud your judgment.
[SYSTEM] With a total of 2, your Insight check fails.
Zev remains an enigma. His offer seems sincere, born of genuine gratitude. But this is Zaun. Is his fear of Scrim greater than a potential fear of you? Is he a good Samaritan or just a very convincing opportunist? You can't get a clear read on him. He just looks like another desperate Zaunite, offering a hand to the person who just saved his skin.
His greasy hand remains outstretched between you two, an open invitation into the underbelly of the city. The decision rests entirely on your gut feeling.
Do you shake his hand and accept his offer?
(I nod slowly, but I don't take his hand) No offense, Zev, but I don't like touching others unless its with my fists. I will take you up on that offer though.
Show thinking
Zev flinches slightly at your words and quickly retracts his hand, wiping it on his trousers as if he'd been the one to offer something unclean. "Oh! Right. No offense taken," he says, his voice a little shaky. "Fists it is. Good policy. A real good policy down here."
He gives the unconscious Scrim one last nervous glance. "Right then. We should... we should go. Before he wakes up or one of his mates comes lookin'."
Zev turns and leads you out of the dead-end alley and back into the slightly wider thoroughfare. He moves with a quick, shuffling gait, sticking to the shadows and keeping his head down. You follow him through a bewildering maze of narrow streets and claustrophobic passages. The world here is a vertical tangle of rusted pipes, rickety catwalks, and grime-covered buildings that lean against each other like tired old men. The air is a thick soup of smells: acrid chemicals, cooking fumes, and the ever-present dampness of the Sump far below. The "Zaun Gray," a permanent chemical haze, filters the sunlight, casting everything in a perpetual twilight.
After a few minutes of twisting and turning, Zev stops in front of a heavy, rust-streaked metal door set into a crumbling brick wall. A low, rhythmic thrumming vibrates through the soles of your shoes. Zev pulls a large, oddly shaped key from his pocket and works the lock. The door groans open, revealing a wave of warm, dry air.
"Here we are," he says, gesturing for you to enter. "Home sweet hovel."
You step inside a large, cavernous boiler room. Massive, copper-plated boilers line one wall, their iron bellies rumbling with contained power. A complex network of pipes, some leaking gentle clouds of steam, crisscrosses the ceiling. In a far corner, sectioned off by a few sheets of corrugated metal, is Zev's living space.
It's not much, but it's more than you had. There's a stained mattress on the floor that serves as a bed, a small crate for a table, and a few shelves crammed with tools, spare parts, and odd bits of salvage. The constant warmth from the boilers makes the space surprisingly comfortable. Most importantly, it feels secure, hidden away from the casual violence of the streets.
Zev watches you take in the space, a hint of pride in his eyes. "It's not the Piltovan Ritz, but the door's solid and no one comes lookin' for trouble in the boilerworks."
He sets the cog-driver you saved on his makeshift table with a reverent clink. "Now that Scrim's not a problem," he says, a new energy in his voice, "I can finally go get the rest of the haul. Had to ditch it when he cornered me. There's a wrecked chem-hauler a few levels down. Found a whole crate of still-sealed shimmer converters. Worth a fortune in cogs to the right buyer."
He looks at you, his expression hopeful. "The thing is, the area's unstable. And now that I think on it, Scrim might not have been the only one who saw me find it. It'd be... safer... with two sets of hands. Especially a pair of fists like yours. What do you say? Help me haul the converters back here, and I'll split the profits with you, fifty-fifty. It'll be a good start for both of us."
(I look around the space a bit) *I could definitely use the cogs... playing houseguest here will get old fast* Yeah. I'll watch your back.
Show thinking
Zev's face breaks into a wide, gap-toothed grin, pure relief washing away the last traces of his earlier fear. "Brilliant! Knew I picked a good one," he says, practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. "You won't regret this. Fifty-fifty, straight down the middle."
He grabs a dusty canvas sack from a shelf and begins stuffing a few tools into it: a wrench, a prybar, and a small, hand-cranked glow-lamp.
"Alright, here's the lay," he begins, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "The wreck is in the lower part of the Alcove, near the edge of the Fissures. It's a tangle of collapsed walkways and busted pipes down there, real treacherous footing. We'll need to be careful. The hauler itself is wedged between two old support pillars, hanging over a pretty steep drop."
He shoulders the sack and looks at you, his eyes gleaming with a mix of excitement and apprehension. "It's not far, but the journey's the tricky part. We ready to move?"
[SYSTEM] I am updating your Player Information Sheet with your new location and active goal. I am also adding Zev's Hovel to the Maps and Locations document.
Lead the way chief.
Show thinking
"Chief. I like the sound of that," Zev says with a nervous chuckle, his confidence momentarily bolstered. "Alright, chief. Stick close. Some of these paths... they ain't on any map."
He unlatches the heavy boiler room door and peeks out into the alley before motioning for you to follow. Once again, you're plunged into the maze of Zaun. Zev leads you away from the more populated thoroughfares and down into a deeper layer of the city. The descent is marked by a series of rickety stairs bolted into the sides of buildings and steep, debris-strewn ramps that wind down into the chasm.
The air grows colder and damper, the chemical tang more pronounced. Here, the walkways are narrower, the gaps between them wider and more frequent. Far below, you can see the faint, sickly green glow of the Sump, a constant, ominous reminder of how far you could fall.
Zev points with a trembling finger to a massive, rusted pipe that runs parallel to a crumbling ledge. "We gotta cross this," he whispers, his voice tight with anxiety. "The walkway collapsed last week. It's the only way to the hauler wreck."
The pipe is about two feet wide and slick with a film of green-black slime. A fall from here wouldn't be lethal, but it would mean a painful drop of about 20 feet onto a pile of jagged scrap metal below.
"Just... don't look down," Zev advises, though he's clearly having trouble following his own advice.
[SYSTEM] To cross the slick, narrow pipe without falling requires balance and agility. Please make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Your New Kid In Town ability grants you advantage on this roll. Roll two d20s, add your Dexterity modifier (+2) and your proficiency bonus (+2), and tell me the highest total.
[I rolled a 21, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 21 is an excellent success.
You look at the slimy, narrow pipe, then at the drop below, and feel a flicker of something that isn't fear—it's focus. The footwork, the balance, the core strength—it's all just another kind of ringcraft.
While Zev hesitates, muttering to himself, you step onto the pipe without a second thought. Your movements are fluid and economical. You find your center of balance instantly, your arms slightly out, your gaze fixed on the other side. You walk across the pipe as easily as if it were a Piltovan boulevard, your worn boots finding purchase on the slick surface where others would slip. You reach the other side in seconds and turn back to watch.
Your confident crossing seems to give Zev the courage he needs. He follows you, but his journey is far less graceful. He inches along, arms windmilling wildly, letting out a few small yelps. He finally stumbles onto the ledge next to you, pale and sweating.
"See? Easy," you say, though Zev doesn't look convinced.
"Right. Easy," he pants, leaning against the rock wall to catch his breath. He then points a shaky finger ahead. "There she is."
Before you lies the wreck. It's a large, armored transport vehicle, its cab crushed against a massive rock pillar. The rear cargo container hangs precariously over the edge of the chasm, groaning under its own weight. The whole area is a mess of twisted metal and shattered rock.
"The converters are in the main cargo bay," Zev says, his voice still a little breathless. "We just need to get the door open."
You approach the rear of the hauler. The cargo door is a thick slab of reinforced steel, but the crash has warped its frame. It's jammed shut, bent and buckled in its housing. There's no lock to pick; this will require pure, brute force.
[SYSTEM] To force the warped cargo door open will require a significant feat of strength. Please make a Strength (Athletics) check. Your New Kid In Town ability grants you advantage on this roll. Roll two d20s, add your Strength modifier (+2) and your proficiency bonus (+2, due to expertise), and tell me the highest total.
(I look at Zev) Let me borrow that pry bar
Show thinking
"Right, right, good thinkin'," Zev says, fumbling in his sack of tools. He pulls out a heavy, rust-pocked prybar, about three feet long, and hands it to you. It has a satisfying weight in your hands. "Here. Should give you better leverage than your knuckles."
You approach the warped door, sizing it up. The metal is bent inwards near the top corner, creating a small gap. It's just wide enough to wedge the tip of the prybar into. This is going to take everything you've got.
[SYSTEM] Using the prybar will give you a better chance. This is a Strength (Athletics) check. Your New Kid In Town ability grants you advantage. Please roll two d20s, add your Strength modifier (+2), your proficiency bonus (+2, from expertise), and an additional +2 bonus for using the prybar. Tell me the highest total.
[I roll a 22, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 22 is a massive success. The tool and your raw power are more than a match for the twisted metal.
You jam the prybar into the gap and take a wide stance, planting your feet firmly on the debris-strewn ground. You let out a sharp grunt, putting your whole body into the effort. The muscles in your back and shoulders bunch as you heave against the tool.
For a moment, the door resists. Then, with a deafening shriek of tortured metal, the warped steel begins to give way. The door groans, pops, and then rips open with a final, violent SCREEECH, swinging wide to reveal the dark interior of the cargo bay. The sound echoes through the surrounding chasms like a dinner bell.
Zev, who had been watching with wide eyes, lets out a whoop of excitement. "You did it! I knew you could!"
Inside, just as he said, is a large wooden crate stamped with the logo of a defunct chem-company. It's about four feet square, clearly heavy.
"That's it! That's the stuff!" Zev says, rushing forward with his glow-lamp. He shines the light into the crate through a gap in the slats. Inside, nestled in straw, are dozens of intricate, brass-and-glass devices—the shimmer converters. They gleam in the lamplight, promising a hefty payout.
But the noise you made was far from subtle.
"Well, well. What do we have here?" a gravelly voice says from behind you.
You and Zev spin around. Blocking the path you came from are two figures who definitely weren't there a moment ago. They're both broad-shouldered and dressed in patched leather and scrap-metal armor. One is bald with a jagged scar across his face, the other has a greasy topknot and is casually tapping a heavy wrench against his palm. They look mean, hungry, and they're both staring right at the open cargo container.
"Heard a bit of a ruckus," says the bald one, a nasty grin spreading across his face. "Sounds like you found something. Something that belongs to us now."
The one with the wrench takes a step forward. "Yeah. We saw that little rat Zev sniffing around here earlier. Knew he was onto something good. Thanks for opening it for us."
Zev shrinks back behind you, his newfound courage evaporating instantly. "Gage... Rella..." he whispers, his voice trembling. "I... I didn't know you were tracking me."
The bald man, Gage, ignores him completely, his eyes fixed on you. "You're new. I'll make this simple. You can walk away. Your little friend here is going to pay us back for the trouble of following him. And we're taking the haul."
[SYSTEM] You are faced with two opponents. This can be resolved through intimidation, deception, or combat. What do you do?
(I start stretching) You know, I'm new to town and I've been cooped up in a cargo hold for FUCKIN' ever. And since I've stepped foot in Zaun... everyone seems to be willing to help me warm up for the day. (I attack Gage) [I roll 9 total]
Show thinking
Your taunts hang in the damp air as you crack your neck, loosening up. Gage just scoffs, unimpressed. "Another tough guy. Zaun eats tough guys for breakfast."
You don't wait for him to finish. You lunge forward, aiming a straight jab at his scarred face, putting your weight behind it.
[SYSTEM] Your attack roll is a 9. However, since Gage hasn't acted yet in combat, your Ambush Predator ability applies. Additionally, your New Kid In Town ability is active. Both of these grant you advantage on this attack roll.
Please roll a second d20. Take the higher of the two rolls, then add your attack bonus (+4 from STR and Proficiency) to get your final result.
While you do that, I'll prepare the combat tracker.

[SYSTEM] With a 14 as the higher roll, your attack hits!
Gage's scoff turns into a grunt of pain as your jab, faster than he anticipated, slips past his lazy guard and smacks squarely into his nose. There's a wet, crunching sound, and he stumbles back, his eyes watering and a stream of red flowing from his nostrils.
"Gah! You broke my damn nose!" he sputters, wiping blood on the back of his hand.
[SYSTEM] Your attack was successful. Please roll for damage. Roll 1d6 and add your Strength modifier (+2).
While you do that, it's the scrappers' turn to retaliate.
Enraged, Gage lunges forward, swinging a wild, blood-slicked fist at your head. [LLM-DM rolling Gage's attack: 1d20+3... result is 11.] His punch is clumsy with rage, and you easily lean back, letting the blow whistle past your ear.
Seeing her partner get hit, Rella raises her heavy wrench and brings it down in a vicious, overhead arc aimed at your shoulder. [LLM-DM rolling Rella's attack: 1d20+3... result is 18.] Her attack is more measured and connects with a solid thump against your arm. However, your Personal Energy Shield flares to life at the point of impact, absorbing the worst of the blow. The wrench bounces off the shimmering field, and you feel nothing.
[SYSTEM] Rella's attack hits your AC, but your Personal Energy Shield has negated the damage for this turn. It is now your turn again.
Gage is bleeding and furious, and Rella is advancing with her wrench. What do you do?
[Rellas attack of 18 is below my AC of 20] [My dmg against Gage is 7]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] You are absolutely right, my apologies. An 18 does not beat your AC of 20. I've corrected the sequence of events and the damage. Thank you for keeping me honest!
Let's rewind that last part.

Your fist connects with a sickening CRACK that echoes off the damp alley walls. Gage's head snaps to the side, a spray of spittle flying from his lips. The 7 points of damage is enough to shatter his nose and his confidence. He stumbles back, eyes watering, a stream of red flowing freely.
"Gah! You broke my damn nose!" he sputters, wiping blood on the back of his hand.
Enraged, Gage lunges forward, swinging a wild, blood-slicked fist at your head. [LLM-DM rolling Gage's attack: 1d20+3... result is 11.] His punch is clumsy with rage, and you easily lean back, letting the blow whistle past your ear.
Seeing her partner get hit, Rella raises her heavy wrench and brings it down in a vicious, overhead arc aimed at your shoulder. [LLM-DM rolling Rella's attack: 1d20+3... result is 18.] Her attack is more measured, but your heightened awareness and instincts from being in a new, dangerous place make you preternaturally quick. You sway just enough for the heavy tool to swing harmlessly past, the displaced air ruffling your clothes. Both of their initial attacks have completely missed.
It's your turn again. Gage is bleeding and furious, clutching his face. Rella is resetting her stance, the heavy wrench looking menacing in her hands.
(I press Gage, aiming to put him down) [I roll 19 total to hit, bonus included]

[SYSTEM] A 19 easily hits Gage's AC of 13. It's another solid blow!
You don't give Gage a moment to recover. Seeing him staggered and clutching his broken nose, you press your advantage. You step in close, feinting with your left before driving a powerful right cross straight into his gut.
The punch lands with a heavy, satisfying thud, knocking the wind out of him and doubling him over with a pained gasp.
[SYSTEM] That's a confirmed hit. Please roll for damage: 1d6 + 2.
[I roll a total 6 for dmg, bonus included]

The punch sinks deep into Gage's gut. All the air rushes out of him in a choked wheeze, and his eyes bulge. For a second, he just stands there, frozen in shock, before his knees buckle and he crumples to the ground, unconscious. The 6 damage was more than his battered body could handle.
[SYSTEM] Gage is defeated. Do you wish to deliver a Lethal or Non-Lethal finishing blow?
Seeing her partner fall so easily, Rella lets out a roar of pure fury. "Gage! You'll pay for that, you topside bastard!"
She hefts her heavy wrench and charges, swinging it wildly at you. [LLM-DM rolling Rella's attack: 1d20+3... result is 15.]
Her rage makes her sloppy. The wrench, which could easily crush a skull, swings wide, smashing into the side of the wrecked hauler with a loud CLANG that sends sparks flying. She missed you completely.
It is now your turn. Rella is open and off-balance from her furious, missed swing.

[SYSTEM] Acknowledged. I will make sure to use the provided immersive as the most up-to-date source for your character information. I will also make Gage's defeat non-lethal.
You fix Rella with a hard glare, your voice low and steady, cutting through her enraged shouts. "Your man is down and I don't like hitting women. Why don't you scrape him up and get the hell out of here?"
For a moment, your cold demeanor gives her pause. Her eyes flicker from your determined face to Gage's unconscious form on the ground. The fury in her expression wars with a dawning sense of self-preservation. You just took down her partner, a tough brawler in his own right, without breaking a sweat.

Your glare cuts through Rella's rage like a shard of glass. It's not just the words; it's the absolute, unshakable confidence behind them. You haven't broken a sweat. You haven't even been touched. You took down her partner with two clean, brutal punches, and now you stand before her, a calm predator who has decided she's not worth the effort.
The fury in her eyes vanishes, replaced by raw, primal fear. The heavy wrench suddenly seems to weigh a thousand pounds in her hands. She looks at Gage's still form, then back at you, and the fight drains out of her completely. She takes a stumbling step back, her knuckles white on the handle of her weapon.
"Y-yeah," she stammers, her voice barely a whisper. "Alright. We're... we're gone."
She drops the wrench with a clatter, the sound echoing loudly in the sudden quiet. Without another word, she scrambles to Gage's side, struggling to haul his dead weight onto her shoulder. She gives you one last, wide-eyed, terrified look before she half-drags, half-carries her unconscious partner away, disappearing back the way they came.
The combat is over. You've won.
[SYSTEM] The encounter is concluded. I will update the tracker with the final rewards. You've earned XP, Skill XP, and whatever loot you can find on the defeated scrappers.
From behind you, Zev lets out a long, shaky breath he seems to have been holding the entire time. "Spirits of the Sump... I thought we were dead," he whispers, peeking out from behind the hauler. He looks at you with an expression of pure, unadulterated awe. "You're... you're incredible. You didn't even get a scratch!"
The immediate area is quiet again, save for the groan of the wrecked hauler. The dropped wrench lies on the ground where Rella left it, and you find a small pouch of coins she must have dropped in her haste. Inside are 85 copper cogs.
The prize, however, is still in the crate.
(I approach the crate) Zaun certainly likes to welcome newcomers.
Show thinking
Zev lets out a nervous laugh, sidling up next to you to peer into the crate. "It's got a funny way of sayin' hello, that's for sure. But it also seems to know how to pick winners." He looks from the unconscious Gage to the spot where Rella fled, then back to you with pure admiration.
You both look down into the crate. It's packed with dozens of the shimmer converters. Each one is a delicate-looking assembly of blown glass, polished brass fittings, and tightly coiled copper wire, all nestled in straw. They seem fragile, but you know that anything designed to channel the volatile power of shimmer has to be tougher than it looks. The whole crate must weigh a ton.
"There they are," Zev breathes, his voice full of reverence. "Beautiful, ain't they? Each one of these is worth a handful of cogs to a chem-head, but a whole set like this? A real tinkerer or an alchemist will pay a premium."
He grabs one side of the heavy wooden crate and tries to lift it, his thin arms straining. The crate barely budges, just scraping an inch across the metal floor of the hauler. Zev lets go, panting.
"Alright," he says, wiping sweat from his brow. "New problem. This thing's heavier than a sump-gator. We're not gonna be able to just carry it back, not across that pipe anyway. We need a plan."
He looks around the wreckage, then at you. "We could try to carry the converters out one by one, but that'll take forever and we're bound to drop a few. Or... maybe we can find something around here to help us move the whole crate at once? A cart, a trolley... something with wheels."
(I pick up Rella's wrench and put it in my bag. I approach the crate and try to pick it up myself)
Show thinking
You stoop down and pick up the heavy wrench Rella dropped. It's a solid piece of iron, greasy and well-used, with a satisfying heft. It feels like it could crack open more than just stubborn bolts. You tuck it away for later.
Then, you turn your attention to the crate. "Stand back, Zev," you say, waving him aside. You plant your feet, bend your knees, and wrap your arms around the massive wooden box. You're strong, stronger than most, and you want to see if you're strong enough.
[SYSTEM] This is a monumental feat of strength. The DC to lift this crate on your own is very high. Please make a Strength (Athletics) check. Your New Kid In Town ability grants you advantage, and you have expertise in this skill. Roll two d20s, add your Strength modifier (+2), your proficiency bonus (+2), and tell me the highest total.
[I have expertise in athletics, does that apply here?]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] Yes, absolutely. You are correct, and my apologies. I missed that on the last check. Your expertise in Athletics means you get to add double your proficiency bonus to any Athletics check.
So for this roll, the correct calculation should be: d20 + STR modifier (+2) + Expertise (+4).
Please go ahead and roll two d20s (for advantage), and add +6 to the higher result.
[I roll nat 20 + 6]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A Natural 20, for a total of 26. That is a phenomenal, critical success.
Zev's jaw hangs open as you wrap your arms around the crate. He's about to say something like, "Don't hurt yourself," but the words die in his throat.
You let out a low grunt, a controlled explosion of power. The muscles in your back and legs tense, and with a smooth, powerful motion that seems to defy physics, you lift the massive crate clean off the floor. The wood groans under the strain, but it holds. You're not just straining to lift it; you're holding it steady at waist height, the sheer weight of it something that should have crushed you.
Zev just stares, his eyes bugging out. He looks at your arms, then at the crate, then back at your arms, as if he can't reconcile what he's seeing. "By the Sump..." he breathes, his voice filled with a new level of awe. "You... you're not just a fighter... you're a monster."
You're holding a crate that likely weighs several hundred pounds, a feat that should be impossible. But you can feel the strain. Your muscles are screaming in protest, and you know you can't hold it for long, and you certainly can't walk across a narrow, slimy pipe while carrying it.
The problem remains: How do you get this back to the hovel?
(I look around for a dolly, cart or other wheeled device)
Show thinking
With a grunt, you carefully set the massive crate back down on the floor of the hauler. Your muscles ache from the brief, intense strain. Lifting it was one thing; moving it is another problem entirely.
"Alright, Zev, you're right," you say, wiping a bead of sweat from your brow. "We need wheels."
You turn your attention from the prize to your surroundings. The area is a junk heap, a testament to the violence of the crash. Twisted girders, shattered rock, and busted panels from the hauler's chassis litter the ground. There's plenty of scrap, but you need something specific. You begin to systematically scan the wreckage, your eyes peeling back the layers of chaos to find anything that might serve your purpose.
[SYSTEM] To find a usable item in this field of debris will require a keen eye. Please make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Your Investigator's Eye and New Kid In Town abilities grant you advantage on this roll. Roll two d20s, take the higher result, and add your Intelligence modifier (+0). Report the total.
[I roll a 14 total, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] With a total of 14, your search is successful.
You tune out Zev's nervous chatter and focus on the task at hand. Your eyes scan the chaotic landscape of the wreck, looking past the obvious junk for something with structure, something with purpose. Most of it is just twisted metal and shattered plating, but then you see it.
Partially buried under a collapsed section of the hauler's side panel is the corner of something with a wheel.
"Zev, give me a hand with this," you say, pointing to the panel.
Together, you manage to heave the heavy sheet of metal aside. Underneath is a heavy-duty, three-wheeled cargo dolly, the kind dockworkers use for moving heavy munitions or chem-barrels. One of the wheels is bent at a sick angle, and the frame is scraped and dented, but it looks structurally sound. It's a lucky find.
"A trolley! Perfect!" Zev exclaims, his eyes lighting up. "I can fix that bent wheel, no problem. Just need to give it a good whack." He pulls the heavy wrench you picked up from his sack (as you had handed it to him to hold). "Let me see that wrench you found."
You hand him the tool. Zev places the bent wheel against a solid piece of wreckage and, with a surprising amount of force for a man his size, gives it a sharp, precise strike. There's a loud CLANG, and the wheel snaps back into a semblance of alignment. It wobbles a bit, but it will roll.
"There we go," he says, beaming with pride. "Good as new... well, good enough."
With the dolly, moving the crate becomes a manageable, two-person job. You provide the muscle, lifting the heavy box onto the trolley, while Zev guides it into place. The journey back is slow and nerve-wracking. You take the lead, pulling the heavy, rattling dolly, while Zev follows behind, helping to lift it over the worst of the debris.
The most harrowing part is crossing the slimy pipe. You have to unload the converters, carry them across a few at a time in Zev's sack, then get the empty crate and the dolly across before reloading everything on the other side. It's tedious, back-breaking work, but you manage it without losing a single converter.
Finally, you arrive back at the boiler room. The heavy metal door groans shut behind you, sealing you into the warm, safe hovel. The crate of shimmer converters sits in the middle of the floor, a testament to a successful and profitable first day in the Undercity.
Zev collapses onto his mattress, exhausted but ecstatic. "We did it," he pants, a massive grin on his face. "We actually did it! We're rich, chief! Rich!" He looks at the crate, then at you. "Alright. A deal's a deal. Fifty-fifty. We just need to find a buyer. I... I might know a guy. A bit of a weirdo, but he pays top cog for quality components. We should lie low for the rest of the day, let the heat from Gage and Rella die down. We can try and fence these tomorrow."
(sit down, back against the wall) Not that this isn't fun... but how can I make some cogs in this town. Is it all fists and salvage?
Show thinking
You slide down the wall, the warmth from the boiler a welcome comfort against your back. Zev, still buzzing with energy, pulls the crate into a corner and covers it with a grimy tarp.
He hears your question and lets out a short, sharp laugh. "Is it all fists and salvage?" He sits down on the edge of his mattress, picking at a loose thread. "Heh. For most of us, yeah. That's the bread and butter. You either find something worth a damn, or you're strong enough to take it from someone who did."
He gestures around his small hovel. "This is what salvage gets you. A warm place to sleep and a full belly, most nights. And what we got in that crate," he nods toward the tarp, "that's a great haul. That'll keep us comfortable for a while. But it's not steady. It's feast or famine."
He leans forward, his voice dropping. "But for someone like you... someone with real talent in their fists... there are other ways. Better ways."
"You've heard of the fight pits, right? The Zaun Underground Circuit? It ain't just alley brawling. It's organized. People bet. Big money. You prove yourself there, you don't just earn cogs, you earn a name. And a name is worth more than cogs down here."
"And then there's work for the big bosses. The Chem-Barons. They're always lookin' for muscle. Enforcers, bodyguards... people to 'collect' debts. Pays well, but you end up on the wrong side of the wrong person, and... well." He draws a finger across his throat.
"So yeah," he finishes, shrugging. "It's mostly fists and salvage. But if you're good enough, you can turn both of those into a real career." He looks at you, a genuine question in his eyes. "You seem like you were made for more than just picking through junk."
I'll update your sheet to reflect that you've made it back to the hovel.
(I nod) Zaun Underground Circuit... that anything like the PPL (Piltover Pugilist League)? I heard about them when I decided to head out this way. I fight, and it seemed like a good way to start off new. (I lean back) Since I'm not exactly welcome in Piltover at the moment... maybe I'll check out this... ZUC. Where can I find em'?
Show thinking
Zev snorts at the mention of the PPL. "Piltover Pugilist League? That's not fighting, chief, that's... dancing with gloves on. Rules, rounds, referees... all very... clean." He gestures to the grime around them. "Nothing down here is clean."
"The ZUC... it's the same idea, I guess, but stripped of all the topside nonsense. There are no weight classes. There are no rules 'cept for 'don't die unless the bet says you should.' You fight, you win, you get paid. You lose, you get dragged out. Simple. It's brutal, but it's honest."
He leans in, his voice dropping again. "As for finding it... it's not a place with a sign on the door. It moves around sometimes, but the main pit is deep in the Fissures. The real heart of the Lanes. You don't just walk in. You gotta be invited, or you gotta get a 'gatekeeper' fight. That's how you get on the roster. You find an unofficial scrap, you win it in front of the right eyes, and someone might give you a nod, tell you where to go."
"Your best bet? Head deeper into the Lanes, towards the markets. Find a dive bar, the rougher the better. Listen. Watch. You'll hear whispers. Or you'll see fighters, guys with scarred knuckles and that look in their eye. The kind of look you've got."
He gives you a meaningful glance. "You want to get into the ZUC, you just have to pick a fight. You've already proven you're good at that."
I'll update your goals on the Player Information Sheet.
(I sit for a while and realize I've had enough of sitting on the flight into Piltover) When do you wanna go see this buyer or whatever? Today, tomorrow?
Show thinking
Zev looks up from the floor, where he's been idly polishing one of the converters with a rag, a dreamy look on his face. Your question snaps him back to reality.
"Whoa there, chief. Easy," he says, holding up a placating hand. "I'm as eager to get paid as you are, believe me. This is the biggest score of my life."
He gets up and peeks through a small crack in the metal door, scanning the alley outside before letting the makeshift curtain fall back into place.
"But think about it," he says, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Gage and Rella, they're not the sharpest tools, but they've got mates. And they saw us. We go waving these converters around today, and someone's gonna connect the dots. Word travels fast in the Lanes, and right now, the word is that two scrappers got their teeth kicked in by a newcomer over a big haul."
He gestures to the tarp-covered crate. "Best we just lay low here for the rest of the day. Let things cool off. Tomorrow morning, bright and early, we'll go see my guy. The market will be busy then, more cover for us to move around. It's the smart play. Safer."
(I'm a bit annoyed... but he's making sense. I reach into my bag and start reading a book that I carry around with me by chemlight.)
Show thinking
You let out a sigh, the sound barely audible over the rhythmic thrum of the boilers. Zev is right, and you know it. Rushing things in a city like this is a good way to end up with a shiv in your back over a handful of cogs. Still, the forced inactivity chafes. You've been sitting for days on that airship, and all you want to do is move.
You resign yourself to the wait. You reach into a hidden pocket inside your worn jacket and pull out a small, dog-eared book. Its cover is plain, unmarked leather, and the pages are soft from countless readings. Zev has a small, jury-rigged glow-lamp on his crate-table, casting a pool of weak, greenish light. You settle against the wall, angle the book to catch the light, and lose yourself in the text.
The hours pass. Zev tinkers with some of his salvage, occasionally glancing over at you with a curious expression. Reading for pleasure is a rare sight in the Undercity.
"What's that you're reading, chief?" he finally asks, unable to contain his curiosity any longer. "Don't see many books down here that aren't repair manuals or... well, I guess mostly just repair manuals."
[SYSTEM] I've noticed the book isn't on your inventory sheet. To make sure I have it right, what kind of book is it? Is it a novel, a history book, a technical manual? I'll add it to your inventory.
(I smirk) Its my diary. [It's A diary, not necessarily Dood's]
Show thinking
Zev's eyes go wide. "A... a diary?" he repeats, his voice dropping to a hush as if you've just revealed a state secret. He takes a half-step back, suddenly looking uncomfortable.
"Oh. Right. Sorry, chief. Didn't mean to pry. A man's... uh... diary is his own business, yeah. Totally." He busies himself by needlessly rearranging some tools on his shelf, avoiding eye contact. "Good place to keep your thoughts straight, I bet. Lots of... thoughts... to have down here."
He gives up on the tools and flops back onto his mattress with a sigh. "Right then. Best we get some shut-eye. Big day tomorrow. Selling the haul, finding you a fight... gonna be a good day." He turns to face the wall, pulling a thin, greasy blanket over his shoulder, clearly signaling the conversation is over. The awkwardness hangs in the warm air for a moment before being swallowed by the constant, comforting hum of the boilers.
[SYSTEM] I've added the diary to your inventory.
(I stay up for a bit before I try to get some sleep too.)
Show thinking
You continue reading for a while longer, the strange, looping script of the diary a familiar comfort in the unfamiliar, warm room. Outside, the sounds of the Undercity shift. The clamor of daytime commerce and arguments fades, replaced by a different set of noises: the distant shriek of faulty machinery, the low throb of music from a hidden dive bar, and occasionally, a sharp shout that's quickly silenced.
Despite the strangeness, the constant, rhythmic thrum of the boilers is a surprisingly soothing sound. It's a steady heartbeat in the heart of the chaos, and for the first time since you were dragged off that airship, you feel a measure of safety. Eventually, your eyelids grow heavy. You mark your page, tuck the diary away, and find a relatively clean patch of floor to curl up on. Sleep comes quickly, deep and dreamless.

You're awoken by the smell of something vaguely edible and the sound of Zev humming a tuneless, cheerful song. You crack your eyes open to see him at his small crate-table, carefully dividing a piece of flat, grayish bread and a small tin of what looks like fish paste.
"Mornin', chief!" he says brightly, noticing you're awake. "Slept like a log in a sump-pipe, you did. Figured you earned some grub." He pushes a piece of the bread and half the tin of paste towards you. "It's Sump-herring paste. An acquired taste, but it sticks to your ribs."
He's already packed a few of the shimmer converters into his canvas sack, which looks heavy and clinks with the sound of glass and brass.
"The Lanes will be stirring now," he says, taking a large bite of his breakfast. "Good time to go see my guy. You ready to go get rich?"
[SYSTEM] The time has advanced. I am updating your Player Information Sheet.
(I eat the provided food) Rich? Like really rich? How much are those things worth?
Show thinking
You wolf down the gritty bread and the surprisingly savory fish paste. It's not gourmet, but it's fuel, and after yesterday, you need it.
Zev watches you, practically vibrating with excitement as he chews. When you ask about the money, his eyes light up.
"Rich? Chief, you have no idea," he whispers, leaning over the crate-table. "See, to a regular sump-scrapper, this is a good score. You could maybe get, what, 20 cogs a piece for these from some back-alley alchemist? Quick sale. But that's chump change."
He taps the side of his nose. "My guy, the one we're gonna see, he's a specialist. A real artist with this stuff. He doesn't just use 'em, he refines 'em. To him, this isn't scrap, it's a palette. He pays for quality. If he likes what he sees, and if they're all in good shape... he might go as high as 40, maybe even 50 cogs a piece."
He does some quick, frantic math on his fingers.
"We got 48 of 'em in there. At 40 cogs... that's nearly 2000 copper cogs. Split down the middle, that's almost a thousand cogs each."
He lets that number hang in the air. A thousand cogs. To put that in perspective, you've earned 230 cogs so far, and that was through three life-or-death fights. This is enough to buy serious gear, bribe your way into places you shouldn't be, or just live without worrying for a good long while.
"Yeah," Zev says, his voice full of awe. "Like I said. Really rich."

[I've attached the item list, it is a csv containing a catalog of in world items. Dynamic items are permissible, but this can serve as a guide] *Really not a whole lot... but its enough to get started* Well, I hope your guy is in the market for whatever the hell those things are.
Show thinking
Zev hears the doubt in your voice and lets out an insistent hiss.
"Oh, he'll be in the market, chief. Trust me," he says, his eyes wide and earnest. "This guy... they call him the 'Alley Alchemist.' He's not just some thug mixing shimmer in a bathtub. He's an artist. He sees things in chem-tech that others don't. And he hates dealing with the big Chem-Baron suppliers. Says their stuff is mass-produced sump-sludge."
He gestures to the sack of converters. "This? This is old-stock, pre-shimmer boom. It's clean. It's pure. To him, this is like finding a case of Piltovan vintage in a trash heap. Oh yeah. He'll be in the market."
He grins, his confidence infectious. "Now, let's go. The sooner we get there, the sooner we can stop talking about being rich and actually be rich."
With that, he hefts the clinking sack of converters, shoulders the boiler-room door open, and leads you back out into the hazy morning light of the Zaunite streets.
(I follow his lead)
Show thinking
You give Zev a nod, and he shoulders the heavy, clinking sack. The journey this time is different. You leave the relative familiarity of the Alcove District and descend deeper into the city's chasms, entering the true heart of Zaun: The Fissures, more commonly known as the Lanes.
The change is immediate and stark. The sky, already a sliver between the leaning buildings, disappears almost entirely, replaced by a dense web of dripping pipes, creaking metal walkways, and makeshift bridges. The air is thick with a chemical haze that stings the eyes and coats the back of your throat. The sounds of the city become a constant, echoing din—the hiss of steam, the grind of unseen machinery, the distant roar of a crowd, and the murmur of a thousand conversations happening just out of sight.
Zev navigates the labyrinth with a practiced ease, leading you down precarious staircases and across swaying rope bridges. He points out landmarks that only a local would recognize: a pipe junction shaped like a grasping hand, a mural of a two-headed sump-rat, a chem-spill that glows with a faint, sickly purple light.
Finally, he stops in a particularly narrow and shadowy alley, tucked away behind a bustling market street where vendors hawk everything from fried grub to second-hand gas masks. He points to a door that seems more like a solid sheet of rusted metal welded to the wall. There are no handles, no hinges, just a small, intricate speaker grille and a single, unblinking glass lens where a peephole should be.
Zev raps on the door in a specific, rhythmic pattern: tap-tap... tap-tap-tap... tap.
A moment of silence, then a crackle from the speaker grille. A voice, reedy and filtered through some strange device, speaks. "The specimen?"
"Fresh," Zev squeaks, his voice tight with nerves. "Old stock. Pre-boom. Forty-eight units."
Another pause. Then a series of loud clicks and hisses emanate from the door as unseen locks disengage. The entire sheet of metal retracts sideways into the wall with a smooth, pneumatic sigh, revealing a dark, circular chamber beyond.
"Enter," the voice commands. "And close the door behind you."
Zev scurries inside, and you follow, the heavy door sliding shut and sealing you in near-total darkness. A moment later, harsh chem-lights flicker on, flooding the room with a sterile, blue-white glare.
The room is a workshop, but unlike any you've ever seen. It's meticulously clean. Every surface is polished steel. Tools aren't scattered about but arranged on magnetic racks with surgical precision. The air doesn't stink of chemicals; it has the clean, sharp smell of pure ethanol and ozone.
Standing in the center of the room is the "Alley Alchemist." He's a tall, unnaturally thin man in a pristine, high-collared leather apron. His head is shaved bald, and his eyes are completely hidden behind a pair of massive, multi-lensed goggles that click and whir as they focus on you. His hands, clad in thin, rubber gloves, are currently adjusting a complex network of glass tubes and beakers that bubble with a clear, viscous fluid.
"Put them on the table," he says, his voice the same reedy, filtered tone from the speaker. He doesn't look away from his experiment. "No sudden movements. This is a delicate process."
Zev nervously empties the sack onto a steel table, carefully arranging the shimmer converters in neat rows. The Alchemist finishes his adjustment, and his goggled head swivels to face the table. He picks up one of the converters, his movements precise and bird-like. The lenses on his goggles click and zoom as he examines every inch of the device.
"Remarkable," he whispers, his voice filled with genuine wonder. "The glass is hand-blown, the filaments are pure copper, not a cheap alloy... the craftsmanship is... exquisite." He looks up, his goggles focusing on Zev, then on you. "The asking price?"
"F-fifty cogs a piece," Zev stammers.
The Alchemist is silent for a long moment, his head tilting. "The price is acceptable," he finally says. He turns to a pneumatic tube system on the wall, types a few commands into a keypad, and a moment later a heavy canvas bag shoots out of a receptacle with a thump. He pushes it across the table. It jingles with the sound of a massive amount of coin.
"2400 copper cogs," the Alchemist states. "A pleasure doing business. Now, leave. You are contaminating my sterile environment."
(I observe the Alchemist. Is the price he agreed to sufficient?) [I roll an insight check]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] Acknowledged. You're trying to read the Alchemist to see if Zev's asking price of 50 cogs was fair, or if this strange man is getting the deal of a lifetime. To gauge his reaction, please make a Wisdom (Insight) check. Your New Kid In Town ability gives you advantage on this roll. Roll two d20s, take the higher result, subtract 1 for your Wisdom modifier, and tell me the total.
You watch the Alchemist as he examines the converters. His body language is nonexistent, a study in stillness. His face is completely obscured by the whirring, clicking goggles. There's no twitch, no tell, no flicker of greed in his eyes because you can't see them. You're trying to read a man who is, for all intents and purposes, a blank, sterile slate. The only thing you have to go on is the tone of his filtered voice and the single word he uttered: "Exquisite."
[I roll a 13 total, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] With a total of 13, your insight check is a success.
You can't read the Alchemist himself—the goggles and voice filter make that impossible. But you can read the situation. You hear the genuine awe in his voice when he calls the converters "exquisite." You see the speed with which he accepted Zev's first offer, without any haggling or hesitation. You note his immediate dismissal, an eagerness to get you out of his lab so he can begin his work.
The conclusion is clear: 50 cogs a piece is a fantastic price for a couple of scrappers. Zev wasn't wrong. But for this particular buyer, for what he wants to do with these specific, high-quality components, he would have paid more. Probably significantly more. You didn't get cheated, not by Zaun standards, but you definitely left money on the table.
Before you can say anything, Zev, looking like he's about to burst with joy, scrambles forward and grabs the heavy sack of coins. "Thank you, sir! A pleasure, a real pleasure!" he says to the Alchemist's back.
The Alchemist simply raises a single, rubber-gloved finger, not turning around. "Leave."
Zev doesn't need to be told twice. He practically drags you towards the exit, clutching the bag of cogs to his chest like a newborn. The heavy metal door slides open, and you step back out into the grimy, familiar haze of the Lanes, the door hissing shut behind you.
Zev leans against the alley wall, breathing heavily, a massive, triumphant grin plastered on his face. He opens the sack, and the sight of the mountain of copper cogs inside makes him laugh, a giddy, relieved sound.
"We did it, chief! We did it!" He immediately begins counting out the coins, creating two large piles on the dirty ground. "1200 for you, 1200 for me. A deal's a deal." He pushes your half towards you. "Never seen so many cogs in my life."
[SYSTEM] Your first major score is complete! I am updating your Player Information Sheet to reflect your new wealth and remove the converters from your inventory.
(I nod as I take the cogs.) You know he would have sold for higher right? I think he might have gone for... 75... maybe 100 a piece to be honest.
Show thinking
You scoop up your pile of cogs, the sheer weight of it a satisfying feeling in your hands. As you stow the small fortune away, you look at Zev, who is still staring at his own pile with wide, disbelieving eyes.
Your words cut through his joyful haze. He looks up at you, blinking. "Higher? Wh-what do you mean, higher? He... he said yes! To fifty! Fifty cogs, chief! That's... that's unheard of!"
He scrambles to his feet, his voice a mix of confusion and defensiveness. "You don't just... you don't just haggle with a guy like the Alchemist! He's not some market stall vendor! You take what he offers, and you say thank you! You push your luck with a guy like that, you don't get more cogs, you get... tested on. Turned into a new kind of sump-herring paste."
He looks at the door, then back at you, the full weight of your observation finally sinking in. His shoulders slump.
"A hundred...?" he whispers, the number sounding alien on his tongue. "You really think...?" He shakes his head, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. "Spirits. I thought I was being bold. I thought I was the big shot asking for fifty." He looks at you, his admiration now mixed with a healthy dose of humility. "You've got a better eye for this stuff than I do, chief. A much better eye."
[SYSTEM] This is a significant moment in your partnership. Zev's already high respect for you has solidified into something more. He sees you not just as muscle, but as a savvy operator. I'm updating your relationship status to reflect this.
But ok, doing much better than we were. (I look around) What kind of bars are around here? I'm looking to spend some of this coin and get a drink. I'll buy you one.
Show thinking
Zev's face splits into a grin at the offer. "A drink? Chief, you're speaking my language! And after a score like this, we've earned it." He quickly scoops his half of the cogs into his sack, his eyes gleaming.
"Alright, so, bars," he says, rubbing his hands together. "We got options, depending on what kinda trouble you're lookin' to get into."
He starts counting on his fingers.
"First, there's 'The Sump-Rat's Nest.' It's a real dive. Full of scrappers, sump-miners, and low-level thugs. The drinks are cheap and taste like paint thinner, but the rumors are fresh. If you wanna hear who's fighting who, or who's hiring muscle, that's a good place to listen. It's just around the corner from here."
"Then you got 'Grizelda's Grub Hub.' It's more of a food stall, but she serves a mean mug of 'Gray-ale.' It's out in the open market, so it's safer. You'll see more merchant types there, people moving goods. Less likely to get you a lead on the ZUC, but also less likely to get a shiv in your ribs."
He hesitates for a moment, then lowers his voice. "And then... there's 'The Last Drop.'" He says the name with a mix of reverence and fear. "That's the most famous bar in all of Zaun. It's run by Sevika, Silco's top lieutenant. It's where the real players go—the chem-barons, the top enforcers, the big names. The drinks are expensive, and the clientele is deadly. You could definitely find a fight there... but it might be your last one. It's not a place you just walk into without a reputation."
He looks at you, weighing your options. "So, what are you feelin', chief? A cheap drink with the rats, a safe meal with the merchants, or a dance with the vipers?"
(I think for a second) The Last Drop... that sounds familiar. (I keep searching for the memory) Oh! Yeah! Is that the place Vander used to own? 'Hound of the Underground'... he's a fuckin' legend! Not a puncher in the world ain't heard of him. We should definitely go there.
Show thinking
Zev's jaw drops. He stares at you, his eyes wide with a mix of shock and disbelief.
"Vander? You... you know about Vander?" he whispers, his voice barely audible over the market din. He glances around nervously, as if speaking the name too loudly might summon an old ghost.
"Yeah, chief," he says, his voice dropping even lower. "It's the same place. But it ain't Vander's place no more. Hasn't been for a long, long time. The sign's the same, but everything else... it's different."
He takes a step closer, his earlier excitement completely gone, replaced by a deep-seated fear. "Listen to me, Dood. That place... it's the heart of Silco's whole operation now. Sevika runs the bar, and she's got an eye that misses nothing and a fist that's even worse. You're right, Vander was a legend. But his time is over. Going in there invoking his name... that's not just brave, it's suicidal."
He clutches the sack of cogs tighter. "We just made the score of a lifetime. Let's not get ourselves killed celebrating. We're not ready for The Last Drop. Not yet. Please, chief. Let's just... let's go to the Sump-Rat's Nest. We can still get a drink, listen for rumors about the ZUC. It's the smart move."
(I think...) Hmmm.... nope. The Last Drop is the spot. (I start walking... and stop, realizing I don't know where to go. I turn to Zev with a look of 'a little help here')
Show thinking
Zev sees the determination in your eyes, and his face pales. He lets out a long, defeated sigh, the sound of a man who knows he's about to do something incredibly stupid but is more afraid of being left behind than of what lies ahead.
"Chief... are you sure?" he asks one last time, his voice barely a whisper. Seeing your resolute expression, he winces and nods. "Alright. Okay. The Last Drop it is. Just... stick close. And let me do the talking if anyone asks. And for the love of the Sump, don't mention Vander."
He shoulders his now much-lighter sack and gestures for you to follow. "This way. And try to look like you belong."
Zev leads you out of the market alley and into one of the main thoroughfares of the Lanes. The crowds are thicker here, a chaotic mix of sump-scrappers, chem-punks with brightly colored hair and crude augmentations, and gaunt-faced workers trudging to or from some miserable job. The air is thick with the smell of fried food, chemical runoff, and something that might be cheap perfume or industrial solvent—it's hard to tell.
After a few minutes of navigating the throng, Zev points up ahead. "There it is."
You see the sign first, an old, wrought-iron affair depicting a single, stylized teardrop. It hangs over the entrance to a wide, sturdy-looking building that seems to have weathered decades of Zaunite abuse. It's bigger than the surrounding structures, with a sense of permanence the other leaning, ramshackle buildings lack. This is The Last Drop.
Even from a distance, you can feel the atmosphere change. The people walking near it give it a wide berth. There are no loiterers near the entrance, only a single, massive bouncer with a chem-augmetic arm that glows with a faint green light. He stands with his arms crossed, his gaze sweeping over the crowd with bored menace. The low, throbbing beat of industrial music leaks from the closed doors, a heavy, intimidating pulse.
Zev has stopped walking and is fidgeting nervously. "Last chance to turn back, chief," he mutters, his eyes fixed on the bouncer. "Place just... feels wrong."
(I don't see that. I just see this unexpected holy ground and can't help myself. I approach the door.)
Show thinking
You tune out Zev's panicked whispers. To you, the building isn't menacing; it's historic. It's a piece of the legend you traveled halfway across the world to follow. The peeling paint and grim bouncer can't tarnish the fact that this was Vander's place. You feel an almost magnetic pull towards the door.
Leaving Zev sputtering in the middle of the street, you walk forward with a calm, steady gait. Your approach does not go unnoticed. The massive bouncer, who had been lazily scanning the crowds, straightens up as you get closer. His gaze locks onto you, and his one good hand comes up, palm out, stopping you about ten feet from the door. His augmetic arm whirs softly, pistons hissing as it adjusts.
"Hold it," he says, his voice a low, gravelly rumble that seems to vibrate in your chest. "Where do you think you're going?" He looks you up and down, taking in your worn clothes and the determined look on your face. "This ain't a flophouse for every sump-scrapper with a pocketful of cogs. State your business."
Behind you, you can hear Zev muttering, "Oh, spirits, here we go..."
[SYSTEM] You are being challenged by the bouncer. You can try to Persuade, Intimidate, or Bribe your way in. What do you do?
(I pull out my sack of cogs) I'm here to drink. (I gesture back to Zev) him too.
Show thinking
The bouncer's eyes flicker down to the heavy sack of cogs in your hand, then back up to your face. The menacing expression doesn't change. He doesn't seem impressed.
"A lot of people have cogs," he rumbles, his voice flat and unimpressed. "Doesn't mean they have sense. We have a certain... clientele. We don't let in trouble." He crosses his massive arms, the augmetic one hissing softly. "So, you've got coin. Why should I believe you're not going to be a problem?"
He's not just looking for a customer; he's sizing you up, trying to decide if you're worth the potential headache.

[I roll a total of 10, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 10 is not enough to sway the formidable bouncer.
You hold up the bag of cogs, a gesture that might work in a lesser establishment. Here, it's met with a stony silence. The bouncer's eyes don't even flicker towards the money. He looks at your face, then at Zev cowering behind you, and lets out a low, humorless chuckle.
"Coin doesn't buy you a seat, friend. It just pays for the drinks if you get a seat," he rumbles. "And you don't have the look. You've got the look of someone who starts trouble, not someone who can handle the trouble that's already inside."
He jerks a massive thumb over his shoulder. "The patrons in there... they don't like new faces. Especially ones that look like they just crawled out of a sump-fight." He takes a half-step forward, his shadow falling over you. "Go on. Find some other dive to drink in. You're not getting in here tonight."
His dismissal is absolute. It's clear that no amount of simple persuasion is going to work. He's a wall, and you can't talk your way through it.
Just as he's about to turn away, his eyes narrow slightly, taking in your posture, the way you hold yourself. He's seen a hundred brawlers, and he recognizes the stance.
"Look," he says, his voice dropping slightly, losing some of its harsh edge. "You want to get into places like this? You want the respect that gets you through doors? You don't earn it with a sack of cogs. You earn it in the pits. You want to drink with the big names? Go make a name for yourself first. Then come back."
With that, he turns his back on you, resuming his post and making it clear the conversation is over.
Zev tugs frantically on your sleeve. "Chief, let's go," he hisses, pulling you away from the door. "He's right. This was a bad idea. C'mon, the Sump-Rat's Nest is this way. First round's on me."
(The idea of going from THE Last Drop to the... Sump-Rat's Nest is chafing. For a moment, I think about trying to knock out the bouncer and walking in... but Zev's insistence and what remains of my common sense prevails. I let Zev pull me away... but I look around the bar for another way in.)
Show thinking
The flash of anger at being denied entry fades, replaced by a stubborn, calculating resolve. The bouncer is a wall, but walls have doors. And windows. And back alleys.
You let Zev pull you away from the front of the bar, feigning defeat. "Alright, alright, you were right," you mutter, just loud enough for him to hear. But as he leads you back into the flow of the crowd, your eyes are scanning every inch of The Last Drop's exterior. You're not looking at it as a bar anymore; you're looking at it as a fortress to be breached.
"That's it, chief, smart move," Zev is saying, relief flooding his voice. "The Sump-Rat's Nest has cheap ale, and no one there has an arm that glows..."
You tune him out, your gaze tracing the building's profile. It's a solid, two-story brick structure wedged between a tenement building and a shop selling repurposed gas masks. The front is impenetrable, but what about the sides?

[I roll a 13 total, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 13 is a success. Your sharp eyes, honed by years of watching opponents in the ring, pick out details that a casual observer would miss.
As Zev is pulling you away, you gently resist, guiding him instead towards the narrow, uninviting gap between The Last Drop and the neighboring gas mask shop. "Just a second, Zev. Let's take the scenic route."
Zev looks nervous but follows you into the alley. It's dark and smells strongly of stale ale, refuse, and the faint, acrid tang of chem-stains. Overflowing metal dumpsters line one wall, buzzing with sump-flies.
Your investigation pays off. About halfway down the alley, you spot it: a heavy, grease-stained service door. It's made of reinforced metal, just like the one to Zev's hovel, and it almost certainly leads to the bar's kitchen or storage area. There's no bouncer here, but the door looks solid and is undoubtedly locked.
Looking up, you spot another potential point of entry. On the second floor, directly above the service door, is a single, grimy window. The glass is dark, and it's impossible to see what's inside, but it's another way in if you're a good enough climber. The brickwork is old and has plenty of gaps that could serve as handholds.
You now have two potential, albeit difficult, ways into The Last Drop, both far from the watchful eyes of the bouncer out front.
(I look at Zev) You wouldn't happen to be good at picking locks would you?
Show thinking
Zev looks from the heavy metal door to you, his eyes wide with a fresh wave of panic.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, chief!" he squeaks, shaking his head so hard his hair flops around. "Picking locks? Spirits, no! I'm a scrapper, not a sneak-thief. I can strip a busted automaton for parts or find a loose cog in a junk pile, but that," he says, pointing a trembling finger at the reinforced door, "that's a whole different beast."
He takes a nervous step back, looking up and down the alley. "And even if I could, that's the back door to The Last Drop! You know who probably has the key? Sevika! You think she doesn't have that thing trapped or warded or... I don't know, rigged to spray acid?"
He looks at you, his expression pleading. "Chief, this is a bad idea. A really, really bad idea. We're rich! We don't need to do this. Let's just go."
Its callin', Zev, and I gotta answer. (I look at the window entry point up top) If you gotta go, I understand. But... (I jump up and start climbing toward the service door on the second floor) I gotta follow my gut.
Show thinking
Zev watches you eye the second-story window, and a look of pure horror dawns on his face. "No. Oh, no no no. Chief, please," he begs, his voice a frantic whisper. "That's not just breaking and entering. That's... that's ringing the dinner bell and climbing into the sump-gator's mouth! That's Sevika's place! We can't!"
You turn to him, your expression unyielding. "It's callin', Zev, and I gotta answer." You give him a small, apologetic shrug. "If you gotta go, I understand. But..."
You don't wait for his reply. You take a running start, leap, and catch a hold on a thick, exposed pipe running up the brick wall. "...I gotta follow my gut."
Zev just stares, paralyzed by a mixture of terror for you and terror of being associated with you. "Spirits, he's actually doing it," he mutters to himself, shrinking back into the deepest shadows of the alley.
The brickwork is old and crumbling, offering plenty of handholds and footholds. It's a straight shot up to the grimy window, about a fifteen-foot climb from where you are.
[SYSTEM] This is a challenging climb that requires your full strength and athletic prowess. Please make a Strength (Athletics) check. Your New Kid In Town ability grants you advantage, and your expertise in Athletics applies. Roll two d20s and add +6 to the higher result.
[I roll a 17 total, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 17 is a solid success.
Your body moves with a fluid, powerful grace. The pipe is your first rung. From there, your fingers find purchase in the crumbling mortar between the bricks, and your feet find footholds on protruding pipes and weathered ledges. It’s less of a climb and more of a vertical dance. You ascend the fifteen feet with practiced ease, your movements efficient and quiet.
Down below, Zev watches with his mouth agape, a small, terrified spectator to your reckless ascent.
You arrive at the window ledge, a narrow outcropping barely wide enough for your feet. You press yourself against the cool brick, peering through the grimy glass. The window is dark, coated with years of Zaun's chemical haze, making it nearly impossible to see inside. You can just make out faint, shifting lights and the low, muffled throb of the music from within.
You test the window. It's an old, simple sash window. You try to slide it up, and to your surprise, it gives way with a low groan, unlocked and stiff from disuse. It seems no one expected an intruder from the second floor.
You've found your way in. The dark opening leads into the unknown upper floor of The Last Drop.
[SYSTEM] I am updating your location.
(I try to sneak and enter the window)
Show thinking
You hoist yourself up onto the ledge, your heart pounding a steady rhythm against your ribs. The window is open, an invitation into the lion's den. Below, you can just see the top of Zev's head as he peeks out from the shadows, wringing his hands. This is it.
You need to be quiet, to slip through the opening like a ghost. The floorboards inside could be creaky, there could be someone just on the other side of the wall. Every sound could give you away.

[I roll a total of 15, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 15 is a success. You're quiet enough to avoid immediate detection.
You take a steadying breath, then swing your body through the open window with the practiced grace of an acrobat. You land on the dusty floor inside in a low crouch, your feet making barely a whisper of a sound. The heavy, thumping bass of the music from downstairs is much louder here, a physical vibration you can feel in the floorboards.
You've made it inside.
You're in what appears to be a storage room. It's cluttered with barrels, crates of cheap liquor, and stacks of unused furniture, all covered in a thick layer of dust. It looks like this room hasn't been seriously used in a long time. Light filters in from the grimy window you just entered and from the cracks around a single, solid-looking wooden door that leads further into the building.
From beyond the door, you can hear the muffled sounds of the bar downstairs: the clink of glasses, a low murmur of conversation, and a sudden, sharp bark of laughter. It sounds like the main bar area is directly below you or down a nearby flight of stairs.
You are undetected, hidden away in the dusty upper floor of The Last Drop. What's your next move?
(I look at the crates of cheap liquor and grab a bottle, I sneak a peak outside the door as I take a sip)
Show thinking
You scan the dusty shelves, your eyes landing on a row of unlabeled green glass bottles. You grab one, popping the cork with your thumb. You bring it to your lips and take a cautious sip. The liquid is harsh and burns all the way down, with a chemical aftertaste that reminds you of rust and regret. It's terrible, but it's strong.
Tucking the bottle into your jacket, you creep over to the door. The wood is thick and heavy. You press your ear against it, the thumping bass from downstairs vibrating through the grain. Carefully, you turn the old brass knob and pull the door inward just a fraction of an inch, creating a tiny vertical slit to peer through.
[SYSTEM] To see what lies beyond without being detected, please make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Your Investigator's Eye and New Kid In Town abilities grant you advantage on this roll. Roll two d20s, take the higher result, subtract 1 for your Wisdom modifier, and tell me the total.
[I roll a 6 total, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 6 is a failure.
You press your eye to the narrow crack, but the view is frustratingly limited. The hallway beyond is dark, lit only by the faint, pulsing glow of the bar's lights filtering up from downstairs. You can make out a wooden railing and the top of a staircase leading down, but that's about it. The angle is all wrong, and the shadows are too deep to see if anyone is in the immediate area. Your ears are more useful than your eyes here; the thumping music and the low murmur of the crowd below are constant, but you can't pick out any specific conversations or footsteps nearby.
For all you know, someone could be standing just out of sight, waiting for the door to open. It's a gamble.
What do you do?
*Fuck it* (I come out of the door and go to the railing with my bottle, dancing to the beat of the music.)
Show thinking
You decide that stealth is no longer the answer. You didn't come all this way to sneak around in the shadows. You came here for a reason.
With a newfound resolve, you pull the door open and step out of the dusty storeroom. You take a swig from the bottle of cheap liquor, the harsh burn a welcome shock to your system. The heavy, industrial beat of the music washes over you, and you let it move you, your body swaying to the rhythm as you walk confidently towards the railing overlooking the main bar.
The upper floor is a wrap-around balcony, a gallery of shadows looking down on the main floor. There are a few rickety tables up here, most of them empty. The air is thick with smoke and the smell of spilled ale. From your vantage point, you have a perfect view of the bar below.
It's a rough, crowded place. The long bar is packed with patrons: hulking chem-punks with glowing augmetics, wiry scrappers with shifty eyes, and a few figures who sit alone in the darkest corners, their faces hidden by shadows and wide-brimmed hats. The whole place hums with a low, dangerous energy.
Your sudden appearance, however, does not go unnoticed.
"Well now. Looks like we got a rat in the rafters," a voice drawls from a nearby table.
You turn. Sitting alone, with her boots kicked up on the table, is a woman. She's lean and wiry, with a shock of bright pink hair cut short and spiky. A pair of goggles is pushed up on her forehead, and a wicked-looking chem-glaive rests against her chair. She's watching you with an amused, predatory grin, a half-empty mug in her hand.
"Lost, big guy?" she asks, her voice laced with mockery. "Or did you just get tired of waiting for an invitation?" She takes a slow sip from her mug, her eyes never leaving yours. "The bouncer usually throws the trash out the front door, not the second-floor window."
(I turn and look at her, calculating her attractiveness as I take another long draw from my recently acquired bottle.) Not lost, just taking in the sights.
Show thinking
She lets out a short, sharp laugh, a puff of air that doesn't disturb her amused grin. "Taking in the sights, huh?" She gestures with her mug towards the bottle in your hand. "And helping yourself to the vintage, I see. That's a bold move."
She leans forward, propping her chin on her hand, her grin widening. The cheap liquor you're drinking suddenly feels very conspicuous.
"The only 'sights' up here are dusty barrels and the back of Sevika's office," she says, her voice a low, playful purr. "So, try again, big guy. Who are you, and what are you really doing in our bar?"
Her tone is light, but her eyes are sharp, and you get the distinct feeling that she's not just making small talk. She's sizing you up, and you're not sure if it's for a conversation, a fight, or something else entirely.
[SYSTEM] I am adding this new character to your Session NPC Summary.
Honestly? (I sit down in a chair at her table, I look around a bit) This is THE Last Drop right? Bar of Vander "Hound of the Underground"? I am a such a fan... I had to see it from the inside. Bouncer be damned.
Show thinking
You pull out a chair and sit down at her table as if you were an old friend. The move is so audacious that Vex just watches you, her mocking grin frozen for a second before it returns, wider and sharper than before.
Your words hang in the air between you. For a moment, the thumping music seems to fade away.
"Vander," she repeats, the name tasting strange on her tongue. She leans back in her chair, her eyes narrowing as she studies you. The playful mockery is gone, replaced by a keen, analytical intensity. "Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long, long time."
She picks up her chem-glaive, balancing the wicked-looking polearm across her lap. "A fan, you say? Of a ghost?" She lets out a low, dangerous chuckle. "You've got guts, big guy. I'll give you that. Or maybe you've just got a head full of rocks."
She leans forward, her voice dropping so only you can hear it over the music. "Let me give you a piece of friendly advice. People don't say that name in here anymore. The only reason your teeth aren't decorating the floor right now is because you said it to me, and I find this... amusing."
Her grin is gone now, replaced by a look of cold calculation. "So, you're a fan of the 'Hound of the Underground.' A man who stood for peace, for keeping the Undercity in its place." She gestures around the bar, at the rough clientele, the chem-punk enforcers, the palpable air of menace. "Does this look like Vander's place to you anymore?"
She poses the question, leaving it hanging in the air. She's not just asking for an opinion; she's testing you, trying to see if you understand the gravity of your mistake.
No, I'm a fan of the 'Hound of the Underground' of LEGEND... I'm from like 100 miles away and I've heard of him. Revolutionary bad-ass. with a punch that could crack granite. I don't know about his bartending days... but... Fuck, he's my brawling idol. (I look her over) You look like you love a scrap... you saying thoughts of his feats don't get your blood going?
Show thinking
Your words make her pause. The hard, calculating look in her eyes softens for just a fraction of a second, replaced by something else... curiosity. She leans back, resting the head of her glaive on the floor, and studies you with a renewed interest.
"The legend," she muses, tapping a finger against her chin. "Not the man who poured drinks and broke up fights, but the man who started them. The one who could crack granite." A slow, genuine smile spreads across her face, and it's far more dangerous than her mocking grin. "Now that is a much more interesting story."
She looks you over, her gaze lingering on your fists. "And you're right. I do love a good scrap. But feats and legends?" She scoffs, the sound sharp and dismissive. "Legends are just stories the old timers tell to forget how bad things are now. Feats get you a statue in Piltover, maybe. Down here, they just get you a target on your back."
She leans forward again, her voice a conspiratorial whisper. "You want to get my blood going, big guy? Don't tell me a story about a dead man. Show me what you can do. You came up here looking for a fight. You've got the look. You've got the guts to say the unsayable. So prove it."
Her eyes flick down to the main floor of the bar, then back to you. "You want to impress me? Go make a memory of your own."
(I take another swig) A memory of my own... I'm not good for much more than punching things really hard. If anyone remembers me... it'll be for a beatin' I've given someone. (I take another swig) I heard you guys have a... ZUG... ZUC? Where that kind of thing happens, the next stop on my tour is there... if I can find it anyway. Hear they're kinda shy.
Show thinking
Vex throws her head back and laughs, a genuine, throaty sound that cuts through the bar's din. "Not good for much more than punching things? Finally, an honest man in Zaun! Most of the guys in here think they're strategists or masterminds. At least you know what you are."
She leans forward, her grin turning sharp and conspiratorial. "ZUC. You got the letters right. And 'shy' is a cute way to put it. It's not a club, big guy. There's no sign-up sheet. You don't find the ZUC. It finds you, but only after you've made enough noise for it to hear you."
Her eyes drift down to the main floor below, scanning the crowd before locking onto a specific target. She gives a subtle nod of her head.
"You want to make some noise? You want your invitation?" she says, her voice a low purr. "See that guy down there at the bar? The big one with the crude, piston-driven arm, trying to look important? That's Jaxom. 'Augment-Arm' Jaxom. He's on the circuit, and he loves nothing more than showing off his toy by putting down newcomers."
She looks back at you, her eyes gleaming with amusement and anticipation.
"So here's your memory to make. Go downstairs. Walk right up to him. And tell him his arm looks like a piece of rusted scrap he pulled out of a gutter. That'll get you the only invitation that matters."
She leans back, takes a long sip of her drink, and gestures towards the staircase with her mug. "Go on, big guy. I'll be watching."
(I take a swig) So you like to watch eh? (I give her another appraising gaze) Ok. (I stand) I usually charge for this though. (I put down the bottle and head downstairs, dancing to the beat as I do so.)
Show thinking
Vex lets out another low chuckle, her eyes gleaming with delight. "Charge for it?" she says, leaning back in her chair and propping her boots back on the table. "Don't worry, big guy. If the show's good enough, I'll cover your tab." She gives you a lazy salute with her mug, settling in to watch from her balcony seat.
You leave the bottle on the table and turn towards the stairs. The heavy, industrial beat of the music seems to seep into your bones. You don't just walk down the stairs; you descend with a confident swagger, your shoulders rolling with the rhythm, a predator moving through his new hunting grounds. The patrons on the main floor, accustomed to the usual gloom and menace, notice the change in energy. Heads turn. Conversations falter. They see a newcomer moving with a purpose and a swagger that spells trouble.
Your eyes lock onto your target. Just as Vex described, a big man is leaning against the bar. His left arm is a monstrosity of scrap metal and pistons, hissing softly with every movement. The limb is bulky and crude, a far cry from the sleek Hextech of Piltover. This is "Augment-Arm" Jaxom. He's loud, laughing with the bartender and gesturing grandly with his oversized metal fist, making sure everyone sees it.
You cut a path directly through the crowd, your easy, rhythmic stride carrying you right to him. The patrons near the bar instinctively give you space, creating a small, clear circle around you and your target.
Jaxom finally notices the sudden quiet and turns, his smile fading as he sees you standing there. "What?" he grunts, his eyes narrowing. "You want something?"
You're standing face to face with him now. The air is thick with tension. From the corner of your eye, you can see the bartender slowly move his hand below the counter. Up on the balcony, Vex leans forward, a rapt audience of one.
This is the moment. This is the memory you came to make. What do you do?
(I look at his augmented arm) That looks all well and good... but how do you... you know? You got a special attachment or something? [I'm preparing an action, dodge. The trigger is an attack]
Show thinking
Jaxom stares at you, his face a mask of confusion for a second. His brain slowly processes the insinuation. Then, his expression curdles into pure rage. The soft hissing of his pneumatic arm becomes a low, angry whine.
"What... did you just say?" he growles, his voice dangerously low.
You just give him a lazy, knowing smirk.
That's all it takes.
"You son of a sump-rat!" he roars, the sound echoing through the now-silent bar. "I'll show you a special attachment!"
He lunges, his massive metal fist swinging in a wide, powerful arc aimed right at your head. The attack is blindingly fast, meant to end the fight before it even begins.
[SYSTEM] Jaxom's attack triggers your prepared Dodge action. Any attack roll made against you before your next turn is made with disadvantage.
[LLM-DM rolling Jaxom's attack with disadvantage: 2d20+5, taking the lower roll... The rolls are 19 and 6. The lower roll is 6. 6 + 5 = 11.]
His mechanical fist, which could easily dent steel plating, whistles past your face. Your prepared dodge allows you to lean back just a fraction of a second before impact, a smooth, practiced movement that makes his powerful swing connect with nothing but air. The force of the missed punch throws him off balance, and he stumbles forward a step.
The entire bar has erupted. Patrons are scrambling out of the way, knocking over chairs and tables to create a makeshift fighting ring in the center of the room. The air is electric with the promise of violence. Up on the balcony, Vex leans forward, a wide, predatory grin on her face. This is exactly what she wanted to see.
[SYSTEM] Combat has begun! It is now your turn.
Combat Encounter: The Last Drop [Concluded]
Jul 17, 1:47 AM
Open
(I punch him and use my bonus action to Dodge) [I roll 20 total to attack]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A total of 20 is a critical hit! Your attack connects with brutal precision.
Jaxom is still off-balance from his wild, missed swing. You see the opening and exploit it instantly. You step inside his reach, ducking under his recovering metal arm, and drive your fist deep into his unprotected side, right below the ribs.
The punch lands with a sickening, meaty thud. You feel a rib give way under the force of your blow. Jaxom lets out a strangled gasp, his eyes wide with shock and agony. The crowd roars its approval.
[SYSTEM] That's a critical hit! Please roll double the damage dice for your Shimmer-Laced Fists: 2d6 + 2.
After landing the devastating body blow, you immediately drop back into a defensive stance, your feet light, your body ready to move.
[SYSTEM] You've successfully used your bonus action to Dodge. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage.
It is now Jaxom's turn. He's clutching his side, his face pale with pain, but the rage in his eyes has been replaced by a grim, murderous focus. He's realized you're not just some loudmouthed punk; you're a serious threat.
[I roll 11 dmg total, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] The 11 damage from your critical hit is registered. It's a devastating blow.
The punch lands like a hammer blow, and a pained, guttural roar is torn from Jaxom's throat. He staggers back, clutching his side, his face a mask of agony and disbelief. The crowd gasps, then erupts into a frenzy of cheers and jeers. He just took a massive hit, and he's still standing, but only just.
Ignoring the pain, he glares at you, his eyes burning with pure, murderous hatred. "You... you're dead," he snarls through gritted teeth. He decides to end this now, one way or another.
He channels all his remaining strength into his augmetic arm. The pistons hiss and whine as they overcharge, glowing with a dangerous red light. He's putting everything into one final, desperate attack—his Haymaker. He swings his massive metal fist in a telegraphed, yet incredibly powerful, overhead smash.
[SYSTEM] Jaxom is using his Haymaker ability. However, because you took the Dodge action, his attack is made with disadvantage.
[LLM-DM rolling Jaxom's attack with disadvantage: 2d20+7, taking the lower roll... The rolls are 16 and 9. The lower roll is 9. 9 + 7 = 16.]
The glowing metal fist descends like a meteor, aimed to turn you into a red paste on the floorboards. But your defensive stance pays off. You see the telegraphed move a mile away. At the last second, you pivot, and the devastating blow smashes into the floor right where you were standing. The floorboards splinter and crack under the immense force, sending a shockwave through the room.
He missed. And now he's wide open, his powerful arm momentarily stuck in the ruined floor.
It's your turn.
(I attack and use bonus action to dodge again.) [I roll total 23 to ATK, bonus included]
Show thinking
[SYSTEM] A 23 is another fantastic hit, and since it's more than 7 over Jaxom's AC of 14, it's another Critical Hit!
Jaxom struggles to pull his augmetic arm from the splintered floorboards, leaving his entire body exposed and off-balance. You don't give him the chance to recover.
You step forward, a predator closing in, and unleash a final, brutal punch. It's not a flashy hook or a powerful cross, but a short, vicious uppercut aimed directly at his jaw. The blow connects with the force of a piston, snapping his head back with an audible crack.
The crowd lets out a collective gasp.
[SYSTEM] That's a critical hit! Please roll for damage: 2d6 + 2.
After delivering the potentially fight-ending blow, you once again smoothly transition into a defensive posture, ready for any retaliation.
[SYSTEM] You've successfully used your bonus action to Dodge. Any attack roll made against you has disadvantage until the start of your next turn.
[I roll 11dmg total, bonus included]
Show thinking
Your uppercut connects with the force of a chem-powered piston. The 11 damage slams through him. Jaxom's head snaps back, his eyes roll up into his skull, and a spray of saliva flies from his mouth. The low whine of his augmetic arm cuts out as he goes completely limp, collapsing bonelessly to the floor in a heap of flesh and metal. He is unconscious before he hits the ground.
The bar, which had been roaring with excitement, falls into a stunned, absolute silence. The only sound is the low throb of the music and the faint hissing of a broken pipe somewhere in the walls. Everyone is staring, not at the fallen Jaxom, but at you. You, the newcomer, who just dismantled one of the bar's toughest regulars in less than a minute without taking a single scratch.
You stand over his unconscious form. You've made your memory.
[SYSTEM] Jaxom is defeated. As per the rules of combat, you have the choice to deliver a Lethal or Non-Lethal finishing blow. What do you do?
I will update the combat tracker to reflect the conclusion of the fight.
[Non-Lethal] (I take the drink that Jaxom was drinking and go back up to join Vex.) Was it as good for you as it was for me?
Show thinking
You leave Jaxom's unconscious form on the floor, not giving him a second glance. You walk over to the bar, where his half-finished drink sits abandoned. Without breaking stride, you pick up the mug, ignoring the bartender who watches you with wide, wary eyes. A quick search of Jaxom's pockets yields a small pouch heavy with 78 copper cogs, which you pocket before turning your back on the scene.
The silence in the bar is a palpable thing. As you walk towards the stairs, the crowd parts for you like a river around a stone. There are no more jeers, no more taunts. The looks you get now are a mixture of fear, awe, and a newfound, grudging respect. You've made your memory.
You take the stairs two at a time, the same swagger in your step, and arrive back at the balcony. Vex is leaning forward, her elbows on the table, her chin resting in her hands. The mocking grin is gone, replaced by a look of pure, unadulterated delight. She watched the whole thing, and she is thoroughly entertained.
You slide back into the chair opposite her, placing Jaxom's captured drink on the table. You take a long, slow sip from the stolen mug, your eyes locked on hers.
"Was it as good for you as it was for me?" you ask, your voice a low, confident rumble.
Vex throws her head back and lets out a genuine, unrestrained laugh. It's a sharp, musical sound that seems to break the tension in the bar.
"Better," she says, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "Much better. I haven't seen a beatdown that clean since... well, ever." She raises her own mug in a toast. "To the new noise in the Undercity."
She takes a drink, her gaze appraising you over the rim of the mug. "You're not just a brawler, are you, big guy? You're a performer. You didn't just win. You made a statement." She leans forward, her voice dropping. "And people heard it. The right people."
She subtly nods towards the bar below. A small, rat-faced man who had been watching the fight intently is now whispering furiously into the ear of a larger, scarred-up individual. They both keep glancing up at you.
"You wanted an invitation to the ZUC?" Vex says with a grin. "Congratulations. I think you just got one."
(I finish Jaxom's mug) Oh, good. (I stand up and stretch) Well, I got a lady waitin' on me (thinking about Zev). When and where should I go for my first day on the job?
Show thinking
Vex lets out a throaty chuckle at your comment, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "A lady waiting, huh? Don't keep her waiting too long. Or maybe," she adds, leaning forward with a conspiratorial grin, "you mean the real lady of the hour. The one who appreciates a good performance."
She drains her mug and sets it down with a solid thunk. "You don't have to go anywhere, big guy. Your first day on the job is coming to you."
Her gaze flicks down to the main floor. The rat-faced man who had been whispering furiously has just slipped away from his companion and is heading for the front door, moving with a quick, furtive scuttle.
"There's your invitation now," Vex says, her voice a low murmur. "That little scrap of a man is named Finn. He's a bookie for the circuit. He finds new talent. Or, in your case, talent finds him."
She stands up, stretching like a contented predator. "He'll lead you right to the front door. The fight will be tonight, when the midnight steam-whistle blows. The venue's an old, repurposed cistern off Sump-Pump Alley. Don't be late."
She gives you a final, appraising look, a genuine smile touching her lips. "I'll be there. Don't disappoint me."
With that, she saunters away towards the back of the balcony, her chem-glaive resting easily on her shoulder, leaving you with a clear mission and a rapidly disappearing guide to follow.
[SYSTEM] Your goal has been updated.
(When she says 'Don't disappoint me' I reply) I wouldn't dare. (I watch her leave before going back out of the bar the way I came. Zev is still there)
Show thinking
You give Vex a confident nod. "I wouldn't dare."
Watching her disappear into the shadows of the upper floor, you turn and head back to the storeroom. The bar is still buzzing about your fight, but no one makes a move to stop you. You slip back into the dusty room, close the door, and climb out the window.
The drop down is easier than the climb up. You land silently in the alley, the sounds of the bar fading above you.
Zev is still there, huddled in the deepest part of the shadows. When he sees you emerge, he nearly jumps out of his skin before relief floods his face.
"Chief! You're alive!" he whisper-shouts, rushing over. "I heard the roaring, the crashing... I thought for sure they were dragging your body out into the street! What happened? Did you get in? Did you see it?"
He's a frantic ball of nervous energy, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and secondhand excitement.
Zev, my friend, we have a date tonight. (I think about the money we made before) And I'm about to make you a whole lot richer. I'm just gonna need you to bet everything you have on me to win tonight. (We walk off as I talk about what happened and our plans for tonight)
Show thinking
Zev's frantic energy from the alley seems to drain away, replaced by a stunned silence as you recount the events inside the bar. He listens with wide eyes as you describe the confrontation with Vex, the challenge, and the swift, brutal dismantling of 'Augment-Arm' Jaxom.
When you tell him your plan for the evening, he stops dead in the middle of the crowded walkway.
"A date?" he squeaks, then his brain catches up. "Oh! The ZUC! Tonight! And you want me to... to bet... everything?"
He looks at the heavy sack of cogs he's carrying, his life-changing score, then back at your confident face. For a moment, pure, unadulterated terror flashes in his eyes. The thought of losing it all, of being right back where he started, is a physical blow.
But then he remembers. He remembers you facing down Scrim. He remembers you intimidating Rella into fleeing. He just heard how you took apart a ZUC-level fighter without taking a scratch. The terror in his eyes is slowly replaced by a wild, manic gleam of greed and hero-worship.
"Everything," he repeats, the word tasting like a gamble and a prayer. He breaks into a huge, trembling grin. "You're mad, chief. Completely, certifiably, sump-fume mad."
He falls into step beside you as you walk back towards the boilerworks, his voice a conspiratorial whisper.
"But I saw what you did to those scrappers. And Jaxom... they say his arm can punch through brick! If you can do that to him..." He clutches his sack of cogs tighter. "Okay. Okay, chief. You got it. I'm in. We're partners, right? Fifty-fifty. I'll bet my half on you. We lose, we're back to scrounging. But if you win..."
He lets out a giddy, nervous laugh. "If you win, we won't just be rich. We'll be legends."
[SYSTEM] I am updating your location as you head back to the hovel to prepare for tonight's fight.
